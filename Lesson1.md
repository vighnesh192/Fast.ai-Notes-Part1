## What I've Understood
- ***Neural Networks*** are the interconnection of neurons.
- Adding just one extra layer of neurons can create models with any level of accuracy but these were very slow to be used.
- Hence, adding more layers to it would increase the performance as well.
- The addition of these multiple layers is known as ***Deep Learning***.
- **Machine Learning:-**
  A model(program) is provided(trained) with ***inputs*** and ***weights***(parameters which can be altered in order to increase the performance) which results into another program(a trained model). 
  And this is an iterative process.

## TODO
- Try running the programs in nb.
- Solve questionnaire.
